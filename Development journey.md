# My App development journey

 I started learning React Native after joining Android Club. It has been a very great experience for me to learn Android App development. I didn't even know Web development fully when I started. So, I had to learn HTML, CSS and JS first and then I jumped into React. For the first few classes, I didn't understand much because of the lack of technical knowledge. But, I started to get a hold of it while doing the assignments on my own. I am really grateful to the Tech leads of Android Club VITC for teaching me React Native and responding to my doubts then and there.
